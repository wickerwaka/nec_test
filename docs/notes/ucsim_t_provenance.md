# ucsim-t provenance ledger — cycle-accurate timing mode

Companion to `docs/notes/ucsim_provenance.md`, which covers the ARCHITECTURAL
model.  This file covers TIME: every timing behaviour the simulator implements,
tagged with where it comes from.  Same discipline, same rule — at closure, the
set of entries still tagged **ASSUMPTION** is precisely "what the assets do not
determine about timing".

Provenance classes:

| class | meaning |
|---|---|
| **ROM** | read directly out of `docs/V20BITS.TXT` via `docs/V20UCDIS.PAS` |
| **LAW** | a law card / frozen black-box oracle inherited from the retired biu-rebuild campaign; cited by artifact |
| **MEASURED** | measured on silicon and recorded in a golden suite, `docs/facts/*`, or a frozen capture; cited by fact |
| **ASSUMPTION** | not determined by the assets; adopted because it reproduces the goldens. Evidence and falsifier recorded. |
| **SCAFFOLDING** | a deliberate placeholder that is KNOWN wrong, kept only so the next stage has something to replace. Every entry names the stage that removes it. |

**Guiding principle (user directive, carried into every entry).** This is 1980s
hardware; NEC wasted no silicon on anything unnecessary.  Complex or confusing
observed behaviour is most likely simple systems interacting in ways we do not
yet understand.  A large fitted table or a many-cased rule is a SIGNAL OF
MISUNDERSTANDING, not a deliverable.  Where an entry below needs a special
case, the special case is written down as an open question, not as a law.

Status: **T0 complete, 2026-08-01.**

## 0. Inherited constraint set

The biu-rebuild campaign (task #34) was retired by user decision on 2026-08-01
(`docs/notes/biu_rebuild_retirement_2026-08-01.md`).  Its law corpus — law
cards C1-C16, the 104 frozen black-box oracle/validation JSONs under
`sw/testdata/biu_blackbox/`, the census artifacts, and the B1-B4 tooling — is
formally INHERITED here as this campaign's constraint set.  Nothing in that
corpus is re-derived; it is either replayed as a gate or explicitly retired
with a reason.

### 0.1 B4 closure adjudication — **NOT ESTABLISHED (the NO-GO stands)**

The campaign plan flagged a documentation contradiction to settle in T0 before
anything relies on `(grid_phase, occupancy, fill)` closure.  Adjudicated here.

**The two claims.**

* `docs/notes/biu_blackbox_campaign.md:3-4` (untracked; mtime 2026-07-30
  22:16): *"Status: **PAUSED before Stage C**. `sw/b4_closure_v2.py` remains a
  NO-GO result and is not evidence that `(phase, occupancy, fill)` closes the
  machine."*
* `docs/notes/biu_rebuild_P1.md:90` (written by commit c23c6c1808,
  2026-07-28 21:29): *"## 6. B4 exp_resume closure — **GO (non-circular
  re-analysis, P1-review blocker 1)**"*, on the strength of w1 0/494 + w3 0/494
  = **0/988** violations, with **21/185 w0** violations excused via design §4a
  coarse-tuple lossiness.

**The plan's hypothesis was that these answer different questions — that the
blackbox doc's NO-GO refers to an ORIGINAL b4_closure predating the
non-circular reanalysis.  That hypothesis is FALSE.**

1. The blackbox doc names `sw/b4_closure_v2.py` **by filename**; it is talking
   about the v2 non-circular script itself.  There is no `sw/b4_closure.py`
   (v1) in the repo or in any commit on any branch — `git log --all
   --diff-filter=A -- 'sw/b4*'` yields only `b4_capture.log`,
   `b4_closure_v2.log`, `b4_closure_v2.py`, `b4_resume_events.json`.  The v1
   analysis was `sw/exp_resume.py sweep` (commit 0b9b00243a), a different tool
   with a different (coarse-tuple + excusal) method.
2. The chronology runs the OPPOSITE way from the hypothesis: c23c6c1808 =
   2026-07-28 21:29; the blackbox doc = 2026-07-30 22:16; the audit in
   `docs/notes/biu_eu_session_summary_2026-08-01.md` = 2026-08-01 09:07.  The
   NO-GO line is the LATER artifact, not the earlier one.
3. The blackbox doc's assertion is literally true of the artifact c23c6c1
   itself committed: `sw/b4_closure_v2.log:31` reads
   `=== B4_V2_VERDICT: NO-GO  (violations=21) ===`.

**Both sides agree on the numbers.**  Re-derived independently from
`sw/b4_resume_events.json` (14,536 events; seeds 0-7, k 0-7,
w ∈ {0:1184, 1:6676, 3:6676}; 9,936 excluded as `eu_ord = -1`):

| w | testable cells | clean | violations |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 185 | 164 | **21** |
| 1 | 494 | 494 | 0 |
| 3 | 494 | 494 | 0 |

1173 testable cells total; 988 at w ≥ 1.  This reproduces
`docs/notes/biu_rebuild_P1.md:98-103` exactly.

**The dispute is therefore about the VERDICT RULE, not the data.**
`sw/b4_closure_v2.py:26-27` pre-registers: *"VERDICT: GO iff 0 testable-cell
violations. Any violation ⇒ NO-GO (routes to the user per the plan).
CONSTANT/CLEAN-PARITY counting is NOT used as the verdict."*  `w` is INSIDE
the match key (line 11-13) and there is no w0 carve-out anywhere in the
pre-registration, even though two other exemptions (non-EU `eu_ord = -1`, and
untestable cells) ARE carved out explicitly in the same block.  The
pre-registration was committed at 21:26:02 and the data run at 21:29:11 —
three minutes later — and the domain was then narrowed to w ≥ 1 in the
interpretive commit.  `docs/notes/biu_rebuild_P1.md:112-114` concedes this in
its own words: *"the literal all-w pre-registration fires on the 21 w0 cells"*.

**The physical excusal is principled; the verdict change is not.**  Design
§4a (`docs/notes/biu_rebuild_design.md:134-182`, dated **2026-07-14**, fourteen
days BEFORE the run) predicts the failure and names the exact violating cell in
advance: *"seed0 eu_ord0 has two phase-shifts (k1,k3) with identical
(phase-parity, occ=4, fill) but resume gap 4 vs 5"* — which is verbatim
`sw/b4_closure_v2.log:9`.  Its argument (the RTL reproduces w0 bit-exactly, so
the distinguishing state is MODELLED and not hidden) is genuine and
falsifiable.  What is post-hoc is changing the falsifier's DOMAIN after seeing
which cells fired, in the one exercise whose entire purpose was to install a
falsifier that could not be argued around.

**Two later objections that have nothing to do with w0** settle it.
`docs/notes/biu_eu_session_summary_2026-08-01.md:31-47`:

> - `sw/b4_closure_v2.py` defines any violation as a NO-GO, and its retained log reports 21 violations and NO-GO.
> - Its match key contains program `seed` and structural `eu_ord`, preventing distinct preparation histories from being compared as the same observable state.
> - It excludes 9,936 non-EU events.
> - Reclassifying `w0` failures using RTL knowledge shows that additional state exists, but does not prove that `(phase, occupancy, fill)` is sufficient.
>
> Accordingly, the reported `w1/w3 0/988` result is treated only as
> within-history repeatability.

With `seed` and `eu_ord` in the match key the test never compares two DIFFERENT
preparation histories, so `0/988` measures repeatability within one program
trace — not state sufficiency — regardless of what one does about w0.

**VERDICT (this ledger, 2026-08-01): B4 closure is NOT ESTABLISHED.  Treat
`B4 = GO` as RETRACTED.**  The defensible residual claim, and the only one this
campaign may cite, is: *within-history phase-parity repeatability holds 988/988
at w1/w3 on EU-preceded resumes.*  `(grid_phase, occ, fill)` may NOT be assumed
to close the machine; per the architecture plan the resume state is keyed on
the full grid state and — per the simplicity principle — the T2 objective is to
collapse it into a mechanism rather than to tabulate it.

**ERRATUM notice (no historical doc edited).**  The following artifacts still
assert `B4 = GO` and are STALE as of the 2026-08-01 audit.  They are historical
records of the retired campaign and are deliberately left untouched:

* `docs/notes/biu_rebuild_P1.md:90` (§6 header) — undercut by its own line 112.
* `docs/notes/biu_rebuild_state.md:50`, `:334`, `:484-488`.
* the biu-rebuild campaign memory file (`B4 exp_resume closure = GO` / `GO
  stands`), which was updated on 2026-08-01 at 11:11 — two hours AFTER the
  audit — without amending the B4 claim.  Highest-priority stale artifact,
  since it is what a future session loads first.

`docs/notes/biu_blackbox_campaign.md:3` is **NOT** an erratum: it is the
current governing statement.

### 0.2 Board scope at T0

None.  T0 is offline by construction; no socket capture, no FPGA flashing.

---

## 1. Architecture — the policy split

### 1.1 `CpuT<Bus>` / `loader_decode<Bus>` — **(refactor, zero behaviour change)**

The interpreter body moved from `sim/exec.cpp` to `sim/exec_impl.h` as
`template <class Bus> class CpuT`, and the pre-decode hardware from
`sim/loader.cpp` to `sim/loader_impl.h` as
`template <class Bus> LoadResult loader_decode(Machine&, Bus&)`.  Two
instantiations exist:

* `sim/exec.cpp` — `template class CpuT<Biu>;`, aliased `using Cpu = CpuT<Biu>;`
  in `sim/exec.h`.  The FUNCTIONAL model.  `sim/biu.{h,cpp}` is untouched.
* `sim/exec_timed.cpp` — `template class CpuT<BiuTimed>;`, aliased
  `using CpuTimed = CpuT<BiuTimed>;`.  The TIMED model.

`sim/exec.h` and `sim/loader.h` carry explicit-instantiation DECLARATIONS
(`extern template`).  That is what makes the split codegen-preserving rather
than merely behaviour-preserving: no translation unit that merely *uses* `Cpu`
instantiates the interpreter for itself, so `case_runner.o` and
`image_runner.o` still hold nothing but undefined references to the single
out-of-line copy in `exec.o` — verified with `nm -C`:

```
case_runner.o:   U sim::CpuT<sim::Biu>::step()
case_runner.o:   U sim::CpuT<sim::Biu>::interrupt(...)
exec.o:          U sim::LoadResult sim::loader_decode<sim::Biu>(...)
loader.o:        W sim::LoadResult sim::loader_decode<sim::Biu>(...)
```

**The Bus concept** (the entire surface the interpreter and the loader need):

```
uint8_t  next_byte(uint16_t cs, uint16_t upc)
uint16_t mem_read (uint16_t seg_val, uint16_t off, bool word, uint8_t seg_idx, uint16_t upc)
void     mem_write(uint16_t seg_val, uint16_t off, uint16_t data, bool word, uint8_t seg_idx, uint16_t upc)
uint16_t io_read  (uint16_t port, bool word, uint16_t upc)
void     io_write (uint16_t port, uint16_t data, bool word, uint16_t upc)
uint16_t inta_read(uint16_t upc)
void     susp();  void flush(uint16_t pc);  void clear_consumed()
long     ev_count() const
```

Ten calls.  That the whole EU/BIU interface is ten calls is itself the reason
the split is cheap, and it is why the timed model can be swapped in without
touching one line of micro-sequencing.

**GATE (measured, this machine, 2026-08-01):**

| gate | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `sw/ucsim_check.py --suite tests/v30/v0.1` | 169000/169000 | 169000/169000 |
| ... wall time, 3 runs | 17.62 / 17.76 / 17.89 s (mean 17.76) | 17.76 / 17.70 / 17.74 s (mean 17.73) |
| `sw/ucsim_check.py --suite tests/v30/v0.2` | 347000/347000, 38.06 s | 347000/347000, 38.71 s then 37.53 s |
| `make -C sim test` (disasm) | PASS | PASS |
| `sw/pla3_check.py` | OK (21 checks) | OK (21 checks) |

v0.1 mean delta = **−0.03 s (−0.2 %)**, inside the 0.27 s spread of the
before-runs.  A later clean-build re-run of the same gate came in at 17.44 s
and v0.2 at 37.53 s, i.e. both suites straddle their pre-refactor times in both
directions — the difference is measurement noise, not a trend.  Zero functional
regression, no measurable perf change.

---

## 2. The naive timed BIU (`sim/biu_timed.{h,cpp}`)

`BiuTimed` implements the same Bus concept and owns a CPU clock.  It COMPOSES a
functional `Biu core_` for the 1 MB epoch-stamped memory, the transaction log,
the write stream and `ev_count()`, and owns only what timing changes: the
prefetch queue and the fetch pointer (a timed fetch is a real word-wide bus
cycle; the functional core fetches one byte at a time on demand).

### 2.1 Bus-cycle shape `T1 T2 T3 [Tw×N] T4` — **MEASURED**

*Evidence:* `tests/v30/v0.1` cycle rows (T-state column), at three wait levels
(`v0.1`, `v0.1-w1`, `v0.1-w3`).

### 2.2 Status is a REGISTERED output, driven ONE clock early — **MEASURED**

The clock immediately before a cycle's T1 already carries that cycle's BS and
its address on AD/PS.  This is the v0.1 README's column-7 note ("the V30
asserts the next cycle's status during T4") stated as a mechanism rather than
as a T4 special case, and the mechanism form is what the goldens actually show:

* `v0.1/B8` case 0 rows 2-3: `T4 CODE 0EBE16` → `T1 CODE 0EBE16` — the T4 row
  carries the NEXT cycle's status AND its address.
* `v0.1/8A` case 0 rows 7-9: `Ti PASV` → `Ti MEMR 5DE73` → `T1 MEMR 5DE73` —
  after an idle gap it is an IDLE row, not a T4 row, that carries the early
  status.  A "T4 shows the next status" rule cannot express this; "one clock
  early, whatever that clock is" can.

*Implementation:* a ONE-CLOCK DELAY BUFFER (`BiuTimed::emit`).  The row for
clock N is handed to the sink only once clock N+1 exists, so committing a cycle
patches its status and address into the row still in flight.  No look-ahead
into the EU is used; the mechanism is exactly a registered output.

*Falsifier:* any golden row where the clock before T1 does not carry the
upcoming BS, or where a clock two before T1 carries it.

### 2.3 Status goes passive after the last data clock — **MEASURED, mechanism OPEN**

Measured on `B8` case 0 at three wait levels:

| waits | active clocks | first passive clock |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | T1, T2 | T3 (cycle-relative index 2) |
| 1 | T1, T2, T3, Tw | T4 (index 4) |
| 3 | T1, T2, T3, Tw, Tw, Tw | T4 (index 6) |

Implemented as `passive_at = (waits == 0) ? 2 : 3 + waits`.

**OPEN QUESTION (T1).**  That conditional is a special case, and by this
campaign's own rule a special case is a signal that two simple machines are
interacting and we have only seen the envelope.  The w0 / w>0 discontinuity is
almost certainly a READY-sampling instant interacting with the T-state
annotation the harness FSM applies, not two different behaviours of the part.
Do not promote this to a LAW until the single mechanism is found.

*Corollary already visible:* combining 2.2 and 2.3, PASV occupies exactly the
clock two before the next T1 and the early status the clock one before, at all
three wait levels — a cleaner statement that may be the real law.

### 2.4 AD phasing — **MEASURED**

* T1: the address-phase (mid-cycle) sample is the address.  The end-of-cycle
  sample is the address too, EXCEPT on a WRITE, where the CPU has already
  switched AD to the write data by the end of T1.  *Evidence:* `v0.1/88` case 0
  row 15 — `MEMW T1`, address `6E259`, data `3F40`.  (This is the same fact
  `sw/check_core.py::diff_rows` records in its col6 comment.)
* T2 through Tw: the data phase, and PS carries S6:S3.
* T4 / Ti: retention of whatever was last driven, unless patched by 2.2.
  *Evidence:* `v0.1/88` case 0 rows 17-19 hold `3F40` through T3, T4, Ti.

### 2.5 PS = S6:S3 = `0 | IE | segment(2)` — **MEASURED**

Segment codes on the pins are ES=0, SS=1, CS=2, DS=3 (note: NOT the same order
as `sim::Sreg`, which is ES,CS,SS,DS — the timed model maps between them).
S5 = the IE flag, read live from the interpreter's PSW (`BiuTimed::bind_psw`).
S6 = 0.

*Evidence:* `v0.1/B8` case 0 `ps=6` = IE|CS with IE set; `v0.1/8A` case 0 row 10
`ps=1` = SS with IE clear; `v0.1/88` case 0 row 16 `ps=5` = IE|SS.

I/O cycles drive the "no segment" code, which is the same encoding as CS —
**MEASURED**, `v0.1/E4` case 0 row 8 (`IOR T2`, `ps=6`).

The internal INT routine's segment-less vector fetch (`kSegZero`) is
**ASSUMPTION**: same "no segment" code.  *Falsifier:* the PS column on the
vector-fetch rows of any `INT.*` golden.

### 2.6 Undriven byte lanes retain — **MEASURED**

A transfer that drives only one lane leaves the other at its previous value.
*Evidence:* `v0.1/8A` case 0 row 10 — an odd-address BYTE read shows the
fetched byte `EC` on AD15-8 beside the stale `90` on AD7-0.

### 2.7 Fetch width and alignment — **MEASURED**

Word fetch from an even address; a single BYTE fetch when the fetch pointer is
odd (the state a flush to an odd PC leaves behind), on the high lane.
*Evidence:* `v0.1/B8` case 0 — CS:IP = `EBE13`, and the golden's fetch stream is
`EBE13` (byte, pre-window) then `EBE14`, `EBE16`, `EBE18` (words).

### 2.8 QS = F on the first pop after an instruction boundary or a flush — **ASSUMPTION**

`Cpu::step()` calls `clear_consumed()` at every instruction boundary and
`kIctlFlush` calls `flush()`; both arm "the next pop is an F".  All other pops
are S.

*Known WRONG for prefixed forms:* the chip emits F for each prefix byte AND for
the opcode after the prefixes (`sw/check_core.py::n_prefix`), so a prefixed
case gets F,S where the golden has F,F.  Consequence: `build_rows_sim` cannot
close the window on a prefixed case, because it needs `n_fpops(golden)` F pops.
*Falsifier / fix:* any prefixed form in the row gate.  **T1.**

## 3. SCAFFOLDING — the T0 simplifications, each with its replacement stage

Every entry here is KNOWN wrong and exists only so the next stage has something
to replace.  None of them may be cited as a law.

| # | scaffolding | why it is wrong | replaced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Strictly serial bus.** One bus cycle at a time; the EU is not a client of the clock, so its actions serialise with the bus instead of overlapping it. | The chip overlaps EU work with bus cycles; a queue pop is a point sample riding an existing bus clock, not a clock of its own. | T1 (BIU master clock, EU as client) |
| S2 | **No prefetch scheduler.** The queue is demand-filled: a fetch is issued only when the decoder asks for a byte the queue does not have. | The chip fetches ahead on a scheduler; the goldens show back-to-back CODE cycles with the queue still holding bytes. | T1 (fetch-scheduler decision at eval points) |
| S3 | **No queue push/pop latency.** A fetched byte is poppable the instant its cycle ends; a pop is instantaneous. | Measured law: push lands at eval+1, poppable at push+2, plus the fresh-on-T2 rule. | T1 (queue latency pipeline) |
| S4 | **No micro-row cadence.** A micro-row costs zero clocks; only bus cycles, queue pops and flushes advance the clock. | `docs/facts/timing_measured.json` holds 306 F-spacing retirement measurements; the ROM's own row cadence is real time. | T1 (cadence calibration ratchet) |
| S5 | **No push/write latency, no write pairing delay.** `emit_pending` issues the write cycle at the moment the interpreter pairs the data. | The chip's write cycle is scheduled by the BIU, not issued by the EU. | T1/T2 |
| S6 | **Uniform waits only.** `--waits N` applies N wait states to every cycle. | The wait axis needs per-access wait vectors and the `wrand` Galois-LFSR generator (`docs/notes/random_wait_rig.md`). | T2 (wait axis) |
| S7 | **No arbitration / maturity model.** Fetch and data accesses never contend, because they cannot overlap (S1). | The whole chip-oracle-v2..v7 corpus is about that contention. | T1 (arbitration rules A/B) |
| S8 | **No flush timing, no BUSLOCK, no HALT display.** `flush()` costs exactly one clock and emits a QS=E point sample; `lock_n` is hardwired inactive. | Measured flush law + NEAR +1-late; BUSLOCK and HALT have their own display rules. | T1 (flush/BUSLOCK/HALT) |
| S9 | **No interrupt/INTA timing.** `timed-run` runs instructions only; the pin-event replay that `case_runner` performs is not implemented in the timed path, so `INT.* / NMI.* / HLT.* / POLL.*` pseudo-forms have no timed arch result. | Scope exclusion inherited from the RTL campaign: interrupt/INTA timing under waits stays OUT of every timed gate until measured. | T4 (board block may open it) |
| S10 | **Instruction-boundary QS=F rule.** See 2.8. | Prefixes each pop an F. | T1 |

---

## 4. Row emission (`sim/rows.{h,cpp}`)

One `ClockRow` per CPU clock, carrying the RAW pin sample set — deliberately
not a synthesized 11-column row.  The golden 11-column `cycles` rows are
DERIVED from these by `sw/check_core.py::build_rows_sim`, and the fuzz /
black-box replay tooling consumes the same raw records
(`sw/check_seq.py::run_image`).  Emitting raw records and letting the
UNMODIFIED python machinery synthesize is what makes the cycle gate cost zero
new comparison code.

* **Emitter (a) `TextRowEmitter`** — `sw/check_core.py::parse_out`'s textual
  format (`= <idx>` / `r <t> <bs> <qs> <ube_n> <ad_addr> <ad_data> <ps> <lock>`
  / `f <14 regs>` / `.`).  Field order, radix and widths are fixed by
  `check_core.py:219` and match `hdl/tb/tb_v30_core.sv:327` exactly; the
  trailing BUSLOCK_N field is emitted for TB parity and ignored by `parse_out`.
* **Emitter (b) `ChipRowsEmitter`** — chip_rows NDJSON, one object per clock,
  keys as `sw/check_seq.py::run_image` builds them (`t`, `bs_early`, `qs`,
  `ube_n`, `ad_addr`, `ad_data`, `ps`) plus `clk` and `upc`.

`upc` attribution is carried on every row: the ROM row that issued the access,
which the functional model already tracked per transaction.  Row-level
attribution therefore comes free.

## 5. Gates

### 5.1 T0 gate commands (runnable, as recorded)

```
make -C sim                                                   # builds both modes

python3 sw/timed_gate.py --sbs B8:0                           # the hand side-by-side
```

### 5.2 T0 results

* **Arch through the timed path:** `tests/v30/v0.2` forms 88, 00, 50, C8,
  1000 cases each = **4000/4000 exact**.  The architectural answer survives the
  swap of the bus policy, which is the T0 claim.
* **Row stream format:** `build_rows_sim` accepted the stream and located the
  golden window in **4000/4000** cases.  Zero parse or synthesis errors.
* **Rows exact:** 0/4000, as expected and pre-stated — there is no timing model
  yet.  Baseline row-diff total 321,961 over 4000 cases, by column:
  `bus 53268, data 51249, tstate 49938, busstat 43771, ube 29288, memcmd 23814,
  seg 23038, pins 21819, qbyte 11375, qop 10596, len 3805`.  This is the
  number T1 ratchets down; it may only ever decrease.

**Full-suite T0 baseline** (`sw/timed_gate.py --suite tests/v30/v0.1 --forms
all`, 169,000 cases, ~40 s).  Recorded so T1 has a complete starting point; not
a gate:

| metric | T0 |
|---|---|
| arch exact | 166,800 / 169,000 |
| golden window located | 152,063 / 169,000 |
| rows exact | 0 / 169,000 |
| row diffs | 9,164,377 |

Both shortfalls are exactly the scaffolding entries this ledger names, with
nothing left over:

* **2,200 arch failures = the 11 pin-event pseudo-forms** at 200 cases each
  (`INT.90 INT.B8 INT.8ED0 INT.8ED8 INT.FB INT.9D INT.F3AA NMI.90 NMI.B8
  HLT.INT HLT.NMI`).  `timed-run` executes instructions only — scaffolding
  **S9**.  The pin-event forms that do NOT fire (`IE0.90`, `HLT.RES`,
  `POLL.LO`, `POLL.REL`) pass.  All 339 other forms are 100 % arch exact.
* **16,937 windows not located** = 15,500 from the 31 PREFIXED forms
  (`26.* 2E.* 36.* 3E.* 64** 65** F2** F3**`, all 500/500) — scaffolding
  **S10** / §2.8, one missing F pop per prefix byte — plus 1,437 from the
  pin-event forms.

Column histogram: `bus 1452888, data 1450343, tstate 1403809, busstat 1197903,
ube 870100, seg 630695, memcmd 613401, pins 557269, qbyte 428085, qop 409346,
len 143977, iocmd 6561`.

**Wait-state path exercised** (`--suite tests/v30/v0.1-w1 --waits 1`, all six
forms, 1200 cases): arch 1200/1200 exact, window 1200/1200, rows exact 0,
row diffs 97,290.  Confirms the §2.3 wait behaviour is wired (status stays
active through T3/Tw at w1 and drops at T4) even though the cycle stream is
still the naive serial one.

**Emitter (b) exercised:** `timed-run --ndjson` produces one well-formed JSON
object per clock plus a finals object; all records parse.

### 5.3 The hand-verified case — `v0.1/B8` case 0, w0

`mov ax, 1580h`, CS:IP = `EBE13`, injected queue empty.  Golden 9 rows, sim 12.

**What already lines up (and therefore needs no work in T1):**

1. **The cycle shape and the pin composition are right.** Sim rows 2-3 are
   byte-identical to golden rows 0-1: `T2 CODE 061580 CS 1580` /
   `T3 PASV 061580 -- 1580`.  Composed bus value, PS→segment decode with the IE
   bit, PASV-at-T3, and the data phase are all correct.
2. **The registered-status handover (§2.2) works.** Sim row 0 is an idle pop
   clock that already carries `CODE 0EBE14`, and sim row 6 carries
   `CODE 0EBE16` — the same one-clock-early mechanism the golden shows at rows
   2 and 6.  The general mechanism was written, not the T4 special case, and it
   fires on a Ti row here exactly as it does on the chip in `8A`.
3. **Fetch addresses, widths and alignment are right**, and the queue byte
   stream is right and in the right ORDER: `B8, 80, 15, 90` on both sides.
4. **The architectural answer is exact** (AX = `1580`, IP = `8556`).
5. **Sim row 7 matches golden row 7 outright** — the one unmarked row.

**What the naive model gets wrong (the T1 work list, in priority order):**

1. **No prefetch scheduler (S2) — the dominant error.** The golden runs code
   fetches back-to-back with zero idle clocks: golden rows 2→3 are T4→T1 of
   consecutive fetches, and the second fetch is issued while the queue STILL
   HOLDS BYTES.  The sim issues a fetch only when the queue runs dry, so
   sim rows 4→7 are T4, Ti, Ti, T1.  Queue occupancy currently decides nothing.
2. **A queue pop costs a whole clock (S1).** Sim rows 0, 5, 6 and 11 are idle
   clocks whose only content is the pop.  On the chip the pop is a point sample
   riding an existing bus clock — golden row 0 is `F` on a T2, row 4 is `S` on
   a T2, row 5 is `S` on a T3.  This is the EU/BIU overlap, and it is the same
   root cause as (1): the EU is not yet a client of the clock.
3. **Consequence of (1)+(2): the stream is 12 rows against the golden's 9**, so
   after row 0 everything is phase-shifted and nearly every column reports a
   diff.  The 45 mismatches on this case are almost entirely alignment, not
   independent errors — which is why the T1 ratchet should be judged on
   `rows_exact`, not on the raw diff total.
4. **T4 shows PASV where the golden shows the next cycle** (sim rows 4 and 10).
   Not a separate bug: the handover can only fire once the EU has asked for the
   next access, and with a scheduler (1) that request would already exist.
5. **The chip overlaps the pop with the in-flight fetch.**  The golden's window
   OPENS with the `B8` pop happening during T2 of the ALREADY-RUNNING fetch of
   `EBE14`; the sim performs the same two events in the same order but
   serialises them.  T1 needs a defined pre-window priming convention so the
   first window row lands on the same clock on both sides.

Nothing in this list is a surprise, and nothing in it contradicts a measured
law — every item is one of the S1-S4 scaffolding entries showing up in the
place the ledger predicted it would.

### 5.4 Standing regressions

The functional gates in 5.1 are standing: every ucsim-t commit keeps them
green, and the functional mode must not regress in behaviour or in measurable
performance.

---

## 6. Open items entering T1

1. **§2.3 mechanism.**  Find the single machine behind the `w == 0 ? 2 : 3+w`
   passive-clock conditional.  Suspect: a READY-sampling instant interacting
   with the harness FSM's T-state labels.  Do not tabulate.
2. **Prefix QS=F rule (§2.8 / S10).**  Blocks the row gate on every prefixed
   form.
3. **Pre-window priming convention.**  Define where the sim's record stream has
   to start so that the golden's window-opening F pop lands on the same clock.
4. **Ratchet definition.**  T1's exact-case counter is `rows_exact` from
   `sw/timed_gate.py`; the pre-registered rule is that it may only grow and
   that the functional gates re-run at every step.
5. **`kSegZero` PS code (§2.5)** is still an ASSUMPTION; the `INT.*` goldens can
   settle it offline.
6. **Inherited oracles are not yet replayed.**  None of the 104 frozen
   black-box JSONs, the `case250` INS factorials, or the INS/ENTER pilot planes
   are wired to the sim yet; those are T1 (L1 unit gates) and T2 (L2 image
   replay).
